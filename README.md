# ViaUtils

Documentation will added as soon as we can get to it. We're focusing on getting [Via](https://github.com/copperpunk-elixir/via) up and running right now (which uses this package as a dependency). Some of these utility functions should be self-explanatory. The others likely won't have documentation until 2022. Sorry :(

## Installation

This package can be installed
by adding `via_utils` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:via_utils, "~> 0.1.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation (when it is written) can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/via_utils](https://hexdocs.pm/via_utils).
